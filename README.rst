Purpose
*******

This is the Catalog micro-frontend application, currently under development.

**What is the domain of this MFE?**

- Home / Index page
- Course About page
- Course Catalog page

These are public-facing pages intended for unauthenticated users.
The goal is to replace legacy views in ``edx-platform`` with modern, React and Paragon-based implementations.

Getting Started
***************

Prerequisites
=============

The Tutor_ platform is a prerequisite for developing an MFE.
Utilize `relevant tutor-mfe documentation`_ to guide you through
the process of MFE development within the Tutor environment.

.. _Tutor: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor

.. _relevant tutor-mfe documentation: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe#mfe-development


Cloning and Startup
===================


1. Clone the repo:

  ``git clone https://github.com/openedx/frontend-app-catalog.git``

2. Use node v20.x.

  The current version of the micro-frontend build scripts support node 20.
  Using other major versions of node *may* work, but this is unsupported.  For
  convenience, this repository includes an .nvmrc file to help in setting the
  correct node version via `nvm <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_.

3. Install npm dependencies:

  ``cd frontend-app-catalog && npm ci``

4. Mount the frontend-app-catalog MFE in Tutor:

  ``tutor mounts add <your-tutor-project-dir>/frontend-app-catalog``

5. Build the Docker image:

  ``tutor images build catalog-dev``

6. Launch the development server with Tutor:

  ``tutor dev start catalog``


The dev server is running at `http://apps.local.openedx.io:1998/catalog/ <http://apps.local.openedx.io:1998/catalog/>`_.

`Tutor <https://github.com/overhangio/tutor>`_. If you start Tutor with ``tutor dev start catalog``
that should give you everything you need as a companion to this frontend.

Internationalization
====================

Please see refer to the `frontend-platform i18n howto`_ for documentation on
internationalization.
